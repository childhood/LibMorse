feel free to use it for what ever you want!

its a libary to send easy mesages in morse-code.
So maybe you will add this in your next geocache ;)


Usage:
***********
put libmorse.c and libmorse.h in your source directory
and add these lines below the include section on your
source file

#include "libmorse.h"

void sleep_ms(uint16_t ms);

void on(void) {
//fill code to turn signal on
}

void off(void) {
//fill code to turn signal off
}

void wait(void) {
//fill code to wait a bit (maybe a secound)
}

and don't vorget to compile libmorse.c too (add it to
your Makefile or use my one^^)
